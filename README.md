# Pengiun movie

This app is my attempt to get familiar with React + TypeScript + Vite. It tries to replicate the netflix ui. Thanks to YuriCPS for his work on [netflix-ui-tailwind](https://github.com/YuriCPS/netflix-ui-tailwind-stydcpnts/) and to Kitwind on [Kometa UI Kit](https://kitwind.io/products/kometa/)

This is still a work in progress.
